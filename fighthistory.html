                            The Ultimate Fighting Championship staged the mixed martial arts contest <strong> UFC 254: <em> Khabib vs. Gaethje </em> </strong> on October 24, 2020, at the du Forum in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. <br> 
                            Khabib Nurmagomedov declared his retirement from mixed martial arts in the post-fight interview, explaining that he had made a vow to his mother that he would not compete  without <br> his late father (who died from complications related to an existing heart condition while positive with COVID-19 in July).    
                            <strong> "Today I want to say it was my last fight. No way I'm <br> gonna come here without my father" </strong> said Nurmagomedov. 
                            <strong> "It was first time after what happened with my father. When UFC called me with Justin, I talked with my mother <br> three days. She don't (want me) to go fight without father, but I promised her it's gonna be my last fight. And if I give my word, I have to follow this." </strong>

                    The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) organised the mixed martial arts event <strong> UFC 229: <em> Khabib vs. McGregor </em> </strong>, which took place on October 6, 2018, at the <br> T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada.  
                    Nurmagomedov entered the bout with a perfect 26-0 record, while McGregor was the first UFC fighter to simultaneously hold titles <br> in two divisions. The president of the organisation, Dana White, referred to the match as <strong> "the biggest in UFC history." </strong>    
                    Following the bout, Nurmagomedov exited the <br> octagon and charged  <strong> Dillon Danis,</strong> McGregor's cornerman. <strong> A fight erupted between McGregor and Abubakar Nurmagomedov </strong> (Khabib's cousin) as they attempted <br> to exit the octagon shortly after. Zubaira Tukhugov and Esed Emiragaev, two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen, <strong> then attacked McGregor inside the octagon. </strong>    
                    The <br> Nevada State Athletic  Commission (NSAC) delayed Nurmagomedov's paycheck for the bout as a result of the incident while it looked into his behaviour. At UFC Fight <br> Night: Volkan  vs  Smith on October 27, Artem Lobov, a teammate of McGregor's who was confronted by Nurmagomedov in April 2018, was to face Tukhugov.    
                    During the <br> post-fight interview, Nurmagomedov apologised to the NSAC and said that the trash-talk directed at his family, country, and religion by the McGregor team as well as <br> the UFC 223 bus incident were the causes of his outburst.    
                    Eventually they were both fined for there roles in the incident by the The Nevada State Athletic  Commission.

                    On April 7, 2018, the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn, New York, played host to the Ultimate Fighting Championship's mixed martial arts event, UFC 223: <br> Khabib vs. Iaquinta.    
                    Following the media day for the event on April 5, Conor McGregor and his group ambushed a bus carrying a number of fighters <br> were supposed to compete there as it was leaving the arena after a press conference. In that bus were Nurmagomedov and two teammates. During the <br> attack, items were thrown through a glass, shattering it. This action caused multiple changes to the event, including the following:    
                    The fight between <br> Artem Lobov and Alex Caceres was cancelled after Lobov was kicked out of the event for having a direct hand in the incident.
                    Michael Chiesa, the <br> lightweight champion of The Ultimate Fighter 15, was set to compete against Anthony Pettis, a former WEC and UFC Lightweight Champion, but he <br> withdrew from the fight after suffering many cuts from a broken window.
                    Seven weeks ago, at UFC Fight Night: Cowboy vs. Medeiros, a flyweight <br> matchup between former UFC Flyweight Championship contender Ray Borg and Brandon Moreno was scheduled to take place. However, the pairing <br> was postponed and rescheduled to occur at this event because Moreno suffered a minor injury. Additionally, this match was called off after Borg <br> experienced problems with glass shards in his eye.    
                    In the end, McGregor surrendered to the NYPD and was detained while charges were being brought. <br> He was eventually charged with three charges of assault and one count of criminal mischief and arrested alongside his SBG teammate Cian Cowley. <br> With bail amounts of $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, they were both freed. After McGregor entered a no contest plea to a count of disorderly conduct <br> for his participation in the brawl and completed five days of community service, the charges were dismissed in late July.
